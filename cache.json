          "description": "Transformers have become the dominant neural network architecture in deep learning. While they are state of the art in language and vision tasks, their performance is less convincing in so-called “reasoning” tasks. In this talk, we consider the “generalization on the unseen (GOTU)\" objective to test the reasoning capabilities of neural networks, primarily Transformers on Boolean/logic tasks. We first give experimental results showing that such networks have a strong “minimal degree bias\" - they tend to find specific interpolators having low degree, in agreement with the “leap complexity” picture derived for classic generalization. Using basic concepts from Boolean Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry, we then characterize such minimal degree profile interpolators and prove two theorems about the convergence of (S)GD to such interpolators on basic architectures. Since the minimal degree profile is not desirable in many reasoning tasks, we discuss various methods to correct this bias and improve consequently the reasoning capabilities. Based primarily on joint works with S. Bengio, A. Lotfi, K. Rizk and E. Adsera-Boix, T. Misiakiewicz.",

This image is centered and set to 50%\npage width. -->\n\n\nA longstanding goal of the field of robot learning has been to create generalist agents that can perform tasks for humans. Natural language has the potential to be an easy-to-use interface for humans to specify arbitrary tasks, but it is difficult to train robots to follow language instructions. Approaches like language-conditioned behavioral cloning (LCBC) train policies to directly imitate expert actions conditioned on language, but require humans to annotate all training trajectories and generalize poorly across scenes and behaviors. Meanwhile, recent goal-conditioned approaches perform much better at general manipulation tasks, but do not enable easy t…",

          "description": "Generative AI systems are already being used to write books, create graphic designs, assist medical practitioners, and are becoming increasingly capable. To ensure these systems are developed and deployed responsibly requires carefully evaluating the potential ethical and social risks they may pose.In our paper, we propose a three-layered framework for evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems. This framework includes evaluations of AI system capability, human interaction, and systemic impacts.We also map the current state of safety evaluations and find three main gaps: context, specific risks, and multimodality. To help close these gaps, we call for repurposing existing evaluation methods for generative AI and for implementing a comprehensive approach to evaluation, as in our case study on misinformation. This approach integrates findings like how likely the AI system is to provide factually incorrect information, with insights on how people use that system, and in what context. Multi-layered evaluations can draw conclusions beyond model capability and indicate whether harm — in this case, misinformation — actually occurs and spreads. To make any technology work as intended, both social and technical challenges must be solved. So to better assess AI system safety, these different layers of context must be taken into account. Here, we build upon earlier research identifying the potential risks of large-scale language models, such as privacy leaks, job automation, misinformation, and more — and introduce a way of comprehensively evaluating these risks going forward.",

          "description": "帧同步可以轻松解决高互动的联网游戏（如格斗，RTS 等）的同步问题，但该方案对延迟很敏感，现在一般省内服务器延迟差不多 10-15ms （1帧），跨省一般 40ms （2-3 帧），在此情况下，使用 Run-Ahead 机制可以有效的掩盖延迟的体感，让用玩家立马看到自己的操作反馈。 该机制有很多其他名字比如：预测回滚（prediction and rollback），或者时间曲力（time warp），名字取的天花乱坠的，很多文章也只是云里雾里说一半天，结果还没说清楚，所以本文打算最简短的句子说清楚这个概念，并给出可以实际操作的实现步骤。 我觉得用 Run-Ahead 这个质朴的名字更容易说明这个算法背后的思想：提前运行，这个概念不光用在游戏同步里，也早已用在游戏模拟器中，为了便于理解，先说一下模拟器中的情况（更简单）。 RetroArch 使用 Run-Ahead 隐藏输入延迟，一般需要设置一下 Run-Ahead 的帧数，比如 0 是关闭，1 是提前运行一帧，2 是提前运行两帧，一般设置用 1，一般不会超过 2 ，设置太高游戏表现会很奇怪： 运行时 RetroArch 为每帧保存快照，假定的是用户输入有持续性，那么运行时当前帧使用上一帧用户的输入作为本帧输入（假设 runahead 设置为 1），然后接着往下运行，如果用户新输入来了，一律把它算作当前帧-1 的输入，然后再去对比历史如果和上一帧所尝试假定的输入一致就继续，否则快照回退到上一帧，重新用新的输入去运行，然后再快进到当前帧。 通常手柄或键盘都有 5ms 左右的输入延迟（部分设备如 switch 的 pro 手柄延迟高达 15ms），再加上操作系统处理的延迟，投递到模拟器进程里，从按下到真正开始处理也许也差不多 1 帧的时间了，RetroArch 用这个功能，也只有用户真实输入和预测输入不一致时才会触发，由于间隔很短，所以即使纠正也难看出来，最终在模拟器上达到了物理设备一样的超低延迟体验。 理解了模拟器的 Run-Ahead 实现，其实在帧同步里的原理也就差不多了，无外乎是用远程的旧输入，搭配本地刚采集到的新输入，作为预测帧的输入值，产生新帧，不匹配了再回滚。 帧同步里引入类似 Run-Ahead 的机制，要求游戏最近所有状态都可以被快速保存、复制和恢复，实现有很多种，你可以用状态的反复前进、后退来实现，但是 BUG 率太高了，这里给出一个更简易的实现方式： […]\nThe post 帧同步游戏中使用 Run-Ahead 隐藏输入延迟 appeared first on Skywind Inside.",

The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications. To address this problem, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of t…",

They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems.

          "description": "Posted by Carlos Esteves and Ameesh Makadia, Research Scientists, Google Research, Athena Team\n\n\n\n\nTypical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. \n\n\n\nUsing methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs…",
