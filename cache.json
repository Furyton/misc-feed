Such models enable the integration of non-numerical data into deep learning models by mapping categorical or string-valued input attributes with large vocabularies to fixed-length representation vectors using embedding layers. These models are widely deployed in personalized recommendation systems and achieve state-of-the-art performance in language tasks, such as  language modeling, sentiment analysis, and question answering. In many such scenarios, privacy is an equally important feature when deploying those models. A…",
