          "description": "Influence Functions are a standard tool for attributing predictions to training data in a principled manner and are widely used in applications such as data valuation and fairness. In this work, we present realistic incentives to manipulate influence-based attributions and investigate whether these attributions can be systematically tampered by an adversary. We show that this is indeed possible for logistic regression models trained on ResNet feature embeddings and standard tabular fairness datasets and provide efficient attacks with backward-friendly implementations. Our work raises questions on the reliability of influence-based attributions in adversarial circumstances. Code is available at [https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/influence-based-attributions-can-be-manipulated](https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/influence-based-attributions-can-be-manipulated).",

Performance and accuracy of float8 pretraining of LLaMa 3 70B, vs bfloat16 (source: https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/enabling-float8-all-gather-in-fsdp2/2359) We are expanding our training workflows to more dtypes and layouts NF4 QLoRA in torchtune Prototype int8 training support Accelerated sparse 2:4 training Low bit Optimizers Inspired by Bits and Bytes we’ve also added prototype support for 8 and 4 bit optimizers as a drop in replacement for AdamW. from torchao.prototype.low_bit_optim import AdamW8bit, AdamW4bit optim = AdamW8bit(model.parameters()) Integrations We’ve been actively working on making sure torchao works well in some of the most important projects in open source. Huggingface transformers as an inference backend In diffusers-torchao as a reference implementation for accelerating diffusion models In HQQ for fast 4 bit inference In torchtune for PyTorch native QLoRA and QAT recipes In torchchat for post training quantization In SGLang for for int4 and int8 post training quantization # Conclusion If you’re interested in making your models faster and smaller for training or inference, we hope you’ll find torchao useful and easy to integrate. pip install torchao There are a lot of things we’re excited about next ranging from going lower than 4 bit, performant kernels for high-throughput inference, expanding to more layers, scaling types or granularities, MX hardware support and supporting more hardware backends. If any of the above sounds exciting you can follow our progress at: https://github.com/pytorch/ao If you’re interested in working on torchao, we’ve created a contributors guide, and if you have any questions we hang out on the #torchao channel on discord.gg/cudamode Acknowledgements We are fortunate to stand on the shoulders of giants and collaborate with some of the best people in open source. Thank you! Bits and Bytes for pioneering work in low bit optimizers and QLoRA Answer.ai for their engineering work to get FSDP and QLoRA composing Mobius Labs for the lovely back and forths on quantization algorithms and low bit kernels HuggingFace transformers for their help in battle testing and integrating our work HuggingFace diffusers for our collaboration on extensive benchmarks and best practices torch.compile so we could write our algorithms in pure PyTorch CUDA MODE for most of our early contributors",

          "description": "我经常有文本处理的需求，例如将 html 转换成纯文本，或者移除 markdown 里的所有连接，或者繁体转换简体。因此我做了一个插件来管理和执行各种外部文本过滤器。 所谓 “文本过滤器” 是一个命令行程序，它从标准输入读取文本，然后进行一些处理后写到标准输出，在 Vim 里可以用原生的 :{range}! xxx 命令将选中文本发送给 xxx 命令的标准输入，然后用该命令的标准输出替换选中文本，这个命令很有用，但每次输入一长串命令略显繁琐，并且过滤器多了以后也很难管理。 因此我做了这个插件来统一管理文本过滤程序，并且提供接口来执行他们： 比如上图演示了将 HTML 转换成文本，以及去除 markdown 中的连接，使用命令 :{range}TP {name} 就能调用名为 {name} 的文本过滤程序了。这些程序可以用你喜欢的语言编写，放到统一的目录，加上可执行属性就行，该插件就能找到它。 而你在调试你的文本过滤脚本时，可以加个叹号 :{range}TP! {name} 这样你就可以在另一个窗口里预览结果，而不会覆盖到原文本： 这样调试起来比较方便反复运行。 编写一个文本过滤脚本也很简单，比如在 ~/.vim/text 目录内创建 “markdown_to_dokuwiki.sh” 文件： #! /usr/bin/bash pandoc -f … Continue reading →\nThe post Vim 文本过滤/文字处理插件 appeared first on Skywind Inside.",
