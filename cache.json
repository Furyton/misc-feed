This, along with the recent multi-modal efforts such as the GPT-4o or Gemini-1.5 model, has expanded the realm of possibilities with AI agents. While this is quite exciting, the large model size and computational requirements of these models often requires their inference to be performed on the cloud. This can create several challenges for their widespread adoption. First and foremost, uploading data such as video, audio, or text documents to a third party vendor on the cloud, can result in privacy issues.

Example: 7B model ‘down time’ for a checkpoint goes from an average of 148.8 seconds to 6.3 seconds, or 23.62x faster.",

The classical Lagrange interpolation formula is what you’d write down if you “just did it.”\n\\[ f(x) = \\sum_{i=0}^n y_i \\cdot \\prod_{j \\neq i}\\frac{x - x_j}{x_i - x_j} \\] I wrote a 2014 article deriving this more gently, and implementing it in Haskell for secret sharing.",
