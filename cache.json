When training common SSL algorithms, we find that the loss descends in a stepwise fashion (top left) and the learned embeddings iteratively increase in dimensionality (bottom left). Direct visualization of embeddings (right; top three PCA directions shown) confirms that embeddings are initially collapsed to a point, which then expands to a 1D manifold, a 2D manifold, and beyond concurrently with steps in the loss.\n\nIt is widely believed that deep learning’s stunning success is due in part to its ability to discover and extract useful representations of complex data.

Growing awareness of the global impact of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) has inspired public discussions about the need for international governance structures to help manage opportunities and mitigate risks involved. Many discussions have drawn on analogies with the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in civil aviation; CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in particle physics; IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in nuclear technology, and intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder organisations in many other domains. And yet, while analogies can be a useful start, the technologies emerging from AI will be unlike aviation, particle physics, or nuclear technology. To succeed with AI governance, we need to better understand: what specific benefits and risks we need to manage internationally, what governance functions those benefits and risks require, what organisations can best provide those functions.",

When you open your eyes, you see the same two objects in the same position. How can you determine if they have been swapped back and forth? Intuition and the laws of quantum mechanics agree: If the objects are truly identical, there is no way to tell. \n\n\n\nWhile this sounds like common sense, it only applies to our familiar three-dimensional world. Researchers have predicted that for a special type of particle, called an anyon, that is restricted to move only in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, quantum mechanics allows for something quite different. Anyons are indistinguishable from one another and some, non-Abelian anyons, …",
