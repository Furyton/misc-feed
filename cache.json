This work builds upon Robotic Transformer 1 (RT-1), a model trained on multi-task demonstrations which can learn combinations of tasks and objects seen in the robotic data. RT-2 shows improved generalisation capabilities and semantic and visual understanding, beyond the robotic data it was exposed to. This includes interpreting new commands and responding to user commands by performing rudimentary reasoning, such as reasoning about object categories or high-level descriptions.",

          "description": "Training large deep learning models requires large datasets. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable cloud object store service used for storing large training datasets. Machine learning (ML) practitioners need an efficient data pipe that can download data from Amazon S3, transform the data, and feed the data to GPUs for training models with high throughput and low latency. In this post, we introduce the new S3 IO DataPipes for PyTorch, S3FileLister and S3FileLoader. For memory efficiency and fast runs, the new DataPipes use the C++ extension to access Amazon S3. Benchmarking shows that S3FileLoader is 59.8% faster than FSSpecFileOpener for downloading a natural language processing (NLP) dataset from Amazon S3. You can build IterDataPipe training pipelines with the new DataPipes. We also demonstrate that the new DataPipe can reduce overall Bert and ResNet50 training time by 7%. The new DataPipes have been upstreamed to the open-source TorchData 0.4.0 with PyTorch 1.12.0.",

For example, a user may want to teach a robot dog to perform a new trick, or teach a manipulator robot how to organize a lunch box based on user preferences. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive internet data have shown a promising path towards achieving this goal. Indeed, researchers have explored diverse ways of leveraging LLMs for robotics, from step-by-step planning and goal-oriented dialogue to robot-code-writing agents. \n\n\n\nWhile these methods impart new modes of compositional generalization, they focus on using lang…",
