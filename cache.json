          "description": "Initial data analysis (IDA) has different goals than your final, production data analysis:\nWith IDA you need to examine the initial data and intermediate results, check your assumptions, and try different approaches.\nExploratory data analysis has similar requirements.\nOnce you’re happy with your approach, and you’re ready to run the analysis in an automated manner, you care a lot more about speed and resource usage.\nThese different goals often benefit from different implementation strategies and tools—unless you have a sufficiently flexible tool like Polars, the super-fast dataframe library.\nIn particular, Polars has two fundamental APIs, each of which is useful in different situations:\n“Eager” mode, which is similar to how Pandas works, is well-suited for initial and exploratory data analysis.\nFor production use, “lazy” mode often execute much faster, with lower memory usage, at the cost of not giving you access to intermediate result.\nIn this article we’ll use both two APIs and see how Polars lets you transition from looking at the data to something we can run even more efficiently in production.\nRead more...",

Our results show that Koala can effectively respond to a variety of user queries, generating responses that are often preferred over Alpaca, and at least tied with ChatGPT in over half of the cases.\nWe hope that these results contribute further to the discourse around the relative performance of large closed-source models to smaller public models.

As the technology continues to improve and robotic agents are more routinely deployed in real-world environments, their capacity to assist in day-to-day activities will take on increasing importance. Repetitive tasks like wiping surfaces, folding clothes, and cleaning a room seem well-suited for robots, but remain challenging for robotic systems designed for structured environments like factories. Performing these types of tasks in more complex environments, like offices or homes, requires dealing with greater levels of environmental variability captured by high-dimensional sensor…",

BayesOpt is a great strategy for these problems because they all involve optimizing black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. A black-box function’s underlying mapping from inputs (configurations of the thing we want to optimize) to outputs (a measure of performance) is unknown.
