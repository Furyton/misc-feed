However, there seems to be a writer’s block settling into the field when it comes to dealing with large images. Large images are no longer rare—the cameras we carry in our pockets and those orbiting our planet snap pictures so big and detailed that they stretch our current best models and hardware to their breaking points when handling them. Generally, we face a quadratic increase in memory usage as a function of image size.\nToday, we make one of two sub-optimal choices when handling large images: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the amount of information and context present in an image. We take another look at these approaches and introduce $x$T, a new framework to model l…",

This translates to a model FLOPS utilization (MFU) and hardware FLOPS utilization (HFU) of 57%. Additionally, we have observed near linear scaling of FSDP to 512 GPUs, implying that training a 7B model on 512 GPUs to 2T tokens using this method would take just under two weeks.",

Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in natural language processing (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.\n\n\n\nRecently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across diverse natural languag…",

However, the development and implementation of such ML tools are often limited by the availability of high-quality data, ML expertise, and computational resources. \n\n\n\nOne way to catalyze the use of ML for medical imaging is via domain-specific models that utilize deep learning (DL) to capture the information in medical images as compressed numerical vectors (called embedd…",
