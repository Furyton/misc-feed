RT-2 shows improved generalisation capabilities and semantic and visual understanding, beyond the robotic data it was exposed to.

Growing awareness of the global impact of advanced artificial intelligence (AI) has inspired public discussions about the need for international governance structures to help manage opportunities and mitigate risks involved. Many discussions have drawn on analogies with the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) in civil aviation; CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in particle physics; IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) in nuclear technology, and intergovernmental and multi-stakeholder organisations in many other domains. And yet, while analogies can be a useful start, the technologies emerging from AI will be unlike aviation, particle physics, or nuclear technology. To succeed with AI governance, we need to better understand: what specific benefits and risks we need to manage internationally, what governance functions those benefits and risks require, what organisations can best provide those functions.",

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a scalable cloud object store service used for storing large training datasets. Machine learning (ML) practitioners need an efficient data pipe that can download data from Amazon S3, transform the data, and feed the data to GPUs for training models with high throughput and low latency. In this post, we introduce the new S3 IO DataPipes for PyTorch, S3FileLister and S3FileLoader. For memory efficiency and fast runs, the new DataPipes use the C++ extension to access Amazon S3. Benchmarking shows that S3FileLoader is 59.8% faster than FSSpecFileOpener for downloading a natural language processing (NLP) dataset from Amazon S3. You can build IterDataPipe training pipelines with the new DataPipes. We also demonstrate that the new DataPipe can reduce overall Bert and ResNet50 training time by 7%. The new DataPipes have been upstreamed to the open-source TorchData 0.4.0 with PyTorch 1.12.0.",

Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.\n\n\nIn “Symbol tuning improves…",

Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot). However, there is still a significant performance gap between these methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised VQA methods, such as MaMMU…",

Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website. Yet searching for the item in an existing search engine is not trivial since precisely describing the fashion item by text can be challenging. To address this fact, composed image retrieval (CIR…",
