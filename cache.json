          "description": "Representation learning in neural networks may be implemented with supervised or unsupervised algorithms, distinguished by the presence or absence of reward feedback. Both types of learning are highly effective in artificial neural networks. In biological systems, task learning has been shown to modify sensory neural representations, but it is not known if these changes are due to supervised or unsupervised learning. Here we recorded populations of up to 70,000 neurons simultaneously from primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas (HVA), while animals learned multiple tasks as well as during unrewarded exposure to the same stimuli. We found that most neural changes in task mice were replicated in the mice with unrewarded exposure. These changes were concentrated in the medial HVAs after mice learned to discriminate visual textures from two different classes. In contrast, the changes were widespread across visual areas after mice learned to discriminate between two exemplars of the same visual class. In both tasks, neural representations of the most recently learned exemplar generalized to new exemplars of the same visual category and the behavior of the mice generalized according to the same rule. These specific neural changes were replicated in mice with unrewarded exposure, suggesting that unsupervised learning plays a major role in visual learning. In task mice only, we found a neural population in anterior HVAs encoding a ramping reward prediction signal, potentially involved in the supervised learning. Our neural results predict that unsupervised pretraining may accelerate subsequent task learning, a prediction which we validated with behavioral training experiments.",

          "description": "Transformers have become the dominant neural network architecture in deep learning. While they are state of the art in language and vision tasks, their performance is less convincing in so-called “reasoning” tasks. In this talk, we consider the “generalization on the unseen (GOTU)\" objective to test the reasoning capabilities of neural networks, primarily Transformers on Boolean/logic tasks. We first give experimental results showing that such networks have a strong “minimal degree bias\" - they tend to find specific interpolators having low degree, in agreement with the “leap complexity” picture derived for classic generalization. Using basic concepts from Boolean Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry, we then characterize such minimal degree profile interpolators and prove two theorems about the convergence of (S)GD to such interpolators on basic architectures. Since the minimal degree profile is not desirable in many reasoning tasks, we discuss various methods to correct this bias and improve consequently the reasoning capabilities. Based primarily on joint works with S. Bengio, A. Lotfi, K. Rizk and E. Adsera-Boix, T. Misiakiewicz.",

Natural language has the potential to be an easy-to-use interface for humans to specify arbitrary tasks, but it is difficult to train robots to follow language instructions.

To ensure these systems are developed and deployed responsibly requires carefully evaluating the potential ethical and social risks they may pose.In our paper, we propose a three-layered framework for evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems. This framework includes evaluations of AI system capability, human interaction, and systemic impacts.We also map the current state of safety evaluations and find three main gaps: context, specific risks, and multimodality. To help close these gaps, we call for repurposing existing evaluation methods for generative AI and for implementing a comprehensive approach to evaluation, as in our case study on misinformation. This approach integrates findings like how likely the AI system is to provide factually incorrect information, with insights on how people use that system, and in what context. Multi-layered evaluations can draw conclusions beyond model capability and indicate whether harm — in this case, misinformation — actually occurs and spreads. To make any technology work as intended, both social and technical challenges must be solved. So to better assess AI system safety, these different layers of context must be taken into account. Here, we build upon earlier research identifying the potential risks of large-scale language models, such as privacy leaks, job automation, misinformation, and more — and introduce a way of comprehensively evaluating these risks going forward.",

          "description": "帧同步可以轻松解决高互动的联网游戏（如格斗，RTS 等）的同步问题，但该方案对延迟很敏感，现在一般省内服务器延迟差不多 10-15ms （1帧），跨省一般 40ms （2-3 帧），在此情况下，使用 Run-Ahead 机制可以有效的掩盖延迟的体感，让用玩家立马看到自己的操作反馈。 该机制有很多其他名字比如：预测回滚（prediction and rollback），或者时间曲力（time warp），名字取的天花乱坠的，很多文章也只是云里雾里说一半天，结果还没说清楚，所以本文打算最简短的句子说清楚这个概念，并给出可以实际操作的实现步骤。 我觉得用 Run-Ahead 这个质朴的名字更容易说明这个算法背后的思想：提前运行，这个概念不光用在游戏同步里，也早已用在游戏模拟器中，为了便于理解，先说一下模拟器中的情况（更简单）。 RetroArch 使用 Run-Ahead 隐藏输入延迟，一般需要设置一下 Run-Ahead 的帧数，比如 0 是关闭，1 是提前运行一帧，2 是提前运行两帧，一般设置用 1，一般不会超过 2 ，设置太高游戏表现会很奇怪： 运行时 RetroArch 为每帧保存快照，假定的是用户输入有持续性，那么运行时当前帧使用上一帧用户的输入作为本帧输入（假设 runahead 设置为 1），然后接着往下运行，如果用户新输入来了，一律把它算作当前帧-1 的输入，然后再去对比历史如果和上一帧所尝试假定的输入一致就继续，否则快照回退到上一帧，重新用新的输入去运行，然后再快进到当前帧。 通常手柄或键盘都有 5ms 左右的输入延迟（部分设备如 switch 的 pro 手柄延迟高达 15ms），再加上操作系统处理的延迟，投递到模拟器进程里，从按下到真正开始处理也许也差不多 1 帧的时间了，RetroArch 用这个功能，也只有用户真实输入和预测输入不一致时才会触发，由于间隔很短，所以即使纠正也难看出来，最终在模拟器上达到了物理设备一样的超低延迟体验。 理解了模拟器的 Run-Ahead 实现，其实在帧同步里的原理也就差不多了，无外乎是用远程的旧输入，搭配本地刚采集到的新输入，作为预测帧的输入值，产生新帧，不匹配了再回滚。 帧同步里引入类似 Run-Ahead 的机制，要求游戏最近所有状态都可以被快速保存、复制和恢复，实现有很多种，你可以用状态的反复前进、后退来实现，但是 BUG 率太高了，这里给出一个更简易的实现方式： […]\nThe post 帧同步游戏中使用 Run-Ahead 隐藏输入延迟 appeared first on Skywind Inside.",

The standard forms of clustering are metric clustering and graph clustering. In metric clustering, a given metric space defines distances between data points, which are grouped together based on their separation. In graph clustering, a given graph connects similar data points through edges, and the clustering process groups data points together based on the connections between them. Both clustering forms are particularly useful for large corpora where class labels can’t be defined. Examples of such corpora are the ever-growing digital text collections of variou…",

Even more challenging is the zero-shot setup, where the LLM is directly prompted with the test question only. \n\n\n\n\nEven though the few-shot setup has dramatically reduced the amount of data required to adapt a model for a specific use-case, there are still cases where generating sample prompts can be challenging.

          "description": "Posted by Yi-Fan Chen, Software Engineer, and Carla Bromberg, Program Lead, Google Research\n\nWildfires are becoming larger and affecting more and more communities around the world, often resulting in large-scale devastation. Just this year, communities have experienced catastrophic wildfires in Greece, Maui, and Canada to name a few. While the underlying causes leading to such an increase are complex — including changing climate patterns, forest management practices, land use development policies and many more — it is clear that the advancement of technologies can help to address the new challenges.\n \nAt Google Research, we’ve been investing in a number of climate adaptation efforts, including the application of machine learning (ML) to aid in wildfire prevention and provide information to…",

While existing features, such as “Did you mean”, already handle simple typo corrections, more complex grammatical error correction (GEC) is beyond their scope. What makes the development of new Google Search features challenging is that they must have high precision and recall while outputting results quickly.\n\n\n\nThe conventional approach to GEC is to treat it as a translation problem and use autoregressive Transformer models to decode the response token-by-token, conditioning on the previously generated tokens.

But perhaps no aspect of quantum theory is as striking as the act of measurement. In classical mechanics, a measurement need not affect the system being studied. But a measurement on a quantum system can profoundly influence its behavior.

There are a number of reasons why city officials might enact their plan, a primary one being a natural disaster, such as a tornado, flood, or wildfire. An evacuation plan can help the community more effectively respond to an emergency, and so could help save lives. However, it can be difficult for a city to evaluate such a plan because it is not practical to have an entire town or city rehearse a full blown evacuation.
