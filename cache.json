          "description": "Over the past decades, the machine learning community has developed tons of data-driven techniques aimed at enhancing learning efficiency, like semi-supervised learning, meta learning, active learning, transfer learning, and more. However, none of these techniques have proven to be highly effective for real-world natural language processing tasks. This shortcoming uncovers a fundamental flaw in machine learning - the absence of reasoning. Humans often learn from just a few examples because of their capacity to reason, as opposed to relying on data statistics. In this talk, I will talk about the large language models (LLM) reasoning work that we pioneered, and show that the techniques we developed can greatly narrow the gap between human intelligence and machine learning - crushed SoTA in the literature while demanding only a few annotated examples and no training. Our work was presented by Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2022 as a showcase of Google AI.",

However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?\n\n\n\nIn “DynIBaR: Neural Dynamic Image-Based Rendering”, a best paper honorable mention at CVPR 2023, we describe a new method that generates photorealistic free-viewp…",

The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…",
