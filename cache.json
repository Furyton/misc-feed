Some of these shifts come from attempting to \"join\" datasets gathered in different contexts,  others may be the result of people's preferences affecting which data they provide to which systems, and even more can arise when peoples' preferences themselves are shaped by ML systems' recommendations. Each of these types of shift require different modeling and analysis to more accurately predict the behavior of ML pipelines deployed in a way where they interact repeatedly with people who care about their predictions.",

          "description": "Naturalistic experimental paradigms in cognitive neuroscience arose from a pressure to test, in real-world contexts, the validity of models we derive from highly controlled laboratory experiments. In many cases, however, such efforts led to the realization that models (i.e., explanatory principles) developed under particular experimental manipulations fail to capture many aspects of reality (variance) in the real world. Recent advances in artificial neural networks provide an alternative computational framework for modeling cognition in natural contexts. In contrast to the simplified and interpretable hypotheses we test in the lab, these models learn how to act in the world from massive amounts of real-world examples (big data) by optimizing big models with millions to billions of parameters. Surprisingly, such models' performance matches human performances on many cognitive tasks, including visual perceptions, language processing, and motor control. At the same time, these models sacrifice understanding in favor of competence by being able to act without knowing why their choices are optimal or preferable in a given context. In this talk, I will ask whether the human brain's underlying computations are similar or different from the underlying computations in deep neural networks. The ability to think and reason using natural language separates us from other animals and machines. In the talk, I will focus on the underlying neural process that supports natural language processing. Our study aims to model natural language processing in the wild. To that end, we recorded intracranial EEG data from epileptic patients while they engaged in open-ended free conversations with their doctors, friends, and family members during a week-long stay in the hospital. I will provide evidence that our neural code shares some computational principles with deep language models. This indicates that, to some extent, the brain relies on overparameterized optimization methods to comprehend and produce language. At the same time, I will present evidence that the brain differs from deep language models as speakers try to convey new ideas and thoughts. Together, our findings expose some unexpected similarities to deep neural networks while pointing to crucial human-centric missing properties in these machines.",

Waymo, for example, has over 700 self-driving cars operating in Phoenix and San Francisco and is currently expanding to Los Angeles.

We describe the dataset curation and training process of our model, and also present the results of a user study that compares our model to ChatGPT and Stanford’s Alpaca. Our results show that Koala can effectively respond to a variety of user queries, generating responses that are often preferred over Alpaca, and at least tied with ChatGPT in over half of the cases.\nWe hope that these results contribute further to the discourse around the relative performance of large closed-source models to smaller public models.

          "description": "Posted by Matthew Streeter, Software Engineer, Google Research\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives play a central role in optimization and machine learning. By locally approximating a training loss, derivatives guide an optimizer toward lower values of the loss. Automatic differentiation frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are an essential part of modern machine learning, making it feasible to use gradient-based optimizers to train very complex models.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut are derivatives all we need? By themselves, derivatives only tell us how a function behaves on an infinitesimal scale. To use derivatives effectively, we often need to know more than that. For example, to choose a learning rate for gradient descent, we need to know something about how the loss function behaves over a small but finite windo…",

Being able to measure and estimate the biological signatures of aging can help researchers identify preventive measures to reduce disease risk and impact. Researchers have developed “aging clocks” based on markers such as blood proteins or DNA methylation to measure individuals’ biological age, which is distinct from one’s chronological age.
