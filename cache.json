          "description": "Over the past decades, the machine learning community has developed tons of data-driven techniques aimed at enhancing learning efficiency, like semi-supervised learning, meta learning, active learning, transfer learning, and more. However, none of these techniques have proven to be highly effective for real-world natural language processing tasks. This shortcoming uncovers a fundamental flaw in machine learning - the absence of reasoning. Humans often learn from just a few examples because of their capacity to reason, as opposed to relying on data statistics. In this talk, I will talk about the large language models (LLM) reasoning work that we pioneered, and show that the techniques we developed can greatly narrow the gap between human intelligence and machine learning - crushed SoTA in the literature while demanding only a few annotated examples and no training. Our work was presented by Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2022 as a showcase of Google AI.",

The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…",

However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.\n\n\n\n\nTo circumvent these deployment challenges, practitioners often choose to deplo…",

As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. However, the majority of GAN models suffer from high computational complexity and the need for a large training dataset.

Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.\n\n\n\nLearning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).
