          "description": "A pen and pencil and paper is nothing if you have nothing to say.\nOtherwise do pretty watercolors and forget it.\n《Reportage\nIllustration: Visual Journalism》是一本介绍 Reportage Illustration\n的书，Reportage Illustration\n按照字面意思翻译大概应该叫做“新闻插画”，但也许称作“新闻速写”更恰当一些，它可以归类到\nVisual\nJournalism\n下面，基本上是指新闻或者艺术工作人员通过现场作画和记录来报道某一个具体的事件。我最初了解到这本书以及这个行业是在公司的艺术兴趣班的一个叫做\nVisual Journalism\n的课上，老师带着大家一起去各种不同的场所，例如音乐会、咖啡店的脱口秀表演、户外甚至是一起观看某个著名的视频演讲等，然后让大家通过速写和文字结合的方式对现场体验进行描绘和记录，关键并不是要画出多么漂亮的画，而是要通过速写的方式记录下当时的氛围、声音、色彩、对话、天气等各种感官体验。\n整体而言还挺好玩的，虽然和照片甚至录音录像相比通过速写能记录下来的信息量极少，但正因为能记录的内容有限，我们需要舍弃大量东西，反而导致我们记录中的内容是在现场令我们印象最深刻的体验（当然要做好这一点也是需要经过许多训练的）。所以再回去看自己当时的涂鸦时可能更容易重现现场的感触和记忆。然而这针对“个人”而言很合理，但是如果读者不是未来的自己，而是作为真正的新闻报道那样的形式给呈现给他人的话，看到杂乱的涂鸦和速记时能够重现的氛围体验有多少就很难讲了。所以我读这本书的一个疑问其实是这个行业究竟是如何存在的。\nThe Times for the 2012 London\nOlympics.\n\n\n\n…",

          "description": "When machine learning models are deployed into the world, they inevitably encounter scenarios that differ from their training data, either novel contexts where the appropriate answers may differ or scenarios with new out-of-distribution inputs. Unfortunately, in such situations, deep neural network models make up answers or misunderstand the context, making the models unreliable. Even if a model makes useful predictions for many examples, such unreliability poses considerable risks when these models are interacting with real people and ultimately precludes models from being useful in safety-critical applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some ways that we might cope with and address the unreliability of neural network models. As an initial coping strategy, I will first discuss a technique for detecting whether some content was generated by a machine learning model, leveraging the probability distribution that the model assigns to different content. Next, I will describe an approach for enabling neural network models to better estimate what they don’t know, such that they can abstain from making predictions on such inputs (i.e. selective classification). I will lastly describe methods for adapting models with small amounts of data to improve their accuracy under distribution shift.",

          "description": "How can we trace surprising behaviors of machine learning models back to their training data? Influence functions aim to predict how the trained model would change if a specific training example were added to the training set. I'll address two issues that have blocked their applicability to large-scale neural nets: apparent inaccuracy of the results, and the difficulty of computing inverse-Hessian-vector products. Towards the former issue, I'll reformulate the goals of influence estimation in a way that applies to overparameterized, incompletely trained models, and argue that the apparent inaccuracy was largely illusory. I'll then discuss an approach to scaling influence estimation to large language models and show some resulting insights into their patterns of generalization.",

A particularly puzzling fact is their ability to learn high-dimensional tasks. Due to the curse of dimensionality (the fact that accurate sampling cannot be achieved in high dimension), this should be generically impossible.  Learnable tasks (such as classifying images) must present a lot of structure, whose nature is debated. I will discuss three properties of data plausibly connected to their learnability: locality, sparsity, and their hierarchical/combinatorial aspect, both from  empirical and simple model viewpoints. I will discuss the importance of distinguishing  different training regimes, when a representation of the data is learnt, or not.",

Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector. However, in real world HGs, there is often a label imbalance issue between different node …",

Depending on the availability of the type of data — negative (normal) vs. positive (anomalous) and the availability of their labels — the task of AD involves different challenges. \n  \n\n\n(a) Fully supervised anomaly detection, (b) normal-only anomaly detection, (c, d, e) semi-supervised anomaly detection, (f) unsupervised anomaly detection.\n\n  \nWhile most previous works were shown to be effective for cases with fully-lab…",

In the last 10 years, AI and ML models have become bigger and more sophisticated — they’re deeper, more complex, with more parameters, and trained on much more data, resulting in some of the most transformative outcomes in the history of machine learning.  \n As these models increasingly find themselves deployed in production and business applications, the efficiency and costs of these models has gon…",
