How could machines learn to reason and plan? Current AI architectures, such as Auto-Regressive Large Language Models fall short.  I will propose a modular cognitive architecture that may constitute a path towards answering these questions.  The centerpiece of the architecture is a predictive world model that allows the system to predict the consequences of its actions and to plan a sequence of actions that optimize a set of objectives. The world model employs a Hierarchical Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (H-JEPA) trained with self-supervised learning. The JEPA learns abstract representations of the percepts that are simultaneously maximally informative and maximally predictable.
