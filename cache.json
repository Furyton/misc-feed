Some of these shifts come from attempting to \"join\" datasets gathered in different contexts,  others may be the result of people's preferences affecting which data they provide to which systems, and even more can arise when peoples' preferences themselves are shaped by ML systems' recommendations. Each of these types of shift require different modeling and analysis to more accurately predict the behavior of ML pipelines deployed in a way where they interact repeatedly with people who care about their predictions.",

          "description": "Naturalistic experimental paradigms in cognitive neuroscience arose from a pressure to test, in real-world contexts, the validity of models we derive from highly controlled laboratory experiments. In many cases, however, such efforts led to the realization that models (i.e., explanatory principles) developed under particular experimental manipulations fail to capture many aspects of reality (variance) in the real world. Recent advances in artificial neural networks provide an alternative computational framework for modeling cognition in natural contexts. In contrast to the simplified and interpretable hypotheses we test in the lab, these models learn how to act in the world from massive amounts of real-world examples (big data) by optimizing big models with millions to billions of parameters. Surprisingly, such models' performance matches human performances on many cognitive tasks, including visual perceptions, language processing, and motor control. At the same time, these models sacrifice understanding in favor of competence by being able to act without knowing why their choices are optimal or preferable in a given context. In this talk, I will ask whether the human brain's underlying computations are similar or different from the underlying computations in deep neural networks. The ability to think and reason using natural language separates us from other animals and machines. In the talk, I will focus on the underlying neural process that supports natural language processing. Our study aims to model natural language processing in the wild. To that end, we recorded intracranial EEG data from epileptic patients while they engaged in open-ended free conversations with their doctors, friends, and family members during a week-long stay in the hospital. I will provide evidence that our neural code shares some computational principles with deep language models. This indicates that, to some extent, the brain relies on overparameterized optimization methods to comprehend and produce language. At the same time, I will present evidence that the brain differs from deep language models as speakers try to convey new ideas and thoughts. Together, our findings expose some unexpected similarities to deep neural networks while pointing to crucial human-centric missing properties in these machines.",

We show how to use Accelerated PyTorch 2.0 Transformers and the newly introduced torch.compile() method to accelerate Large Language Models on the example of nanoGPT, a compact open-source implementation of the GPT model from Andrej Karpathy. Using the new scaled dot product attention operator introduced with Accelerated PT2 Transformers, we select the flash_attention custom kernel and achieve faster training time per batch (measured with Nvidia A100 GPUs), going from a ~143ms/batch baseline to ~113 ms/batch. In addition, the enhanced implementation using the SDPA operator offers better numerical stability. Finally, further optimizations are achieved using padded inputs, which when combined with flash attention lead to ~87ms/batch.",

The first draft was finished in 2000, but with several missing pieces.  Even when a complete reference genome was achieved in 2022, their work was not finished. A single reference genome can’t incorporate known genetic variations, such as the variants for the gene determining whether a person has a blood type A, B, AB or O. Furthermore, the reference genome didn’t represent the vast diversity of human ancestries, making it less useful for detecting disease or finding cures for people from some backgrounds than others.

Two main and disjoint training scenarios are popular: a CLIP-style contrastive learning and next-token prediction. Contrastive learning trains the model to predict if image-text pairs correctly match, effectively building visual and text representations for the corresponding image and text inputs, whereas next-token prediction predicts the most likely next text token in a sequence, thus learning to generate text, according to the required task.

However, this is also a challenging problem as the robot needs to perceive its surroundings, and then explore to identify feasible paths towards the goal. Another common challenge is that the robot needs to overcome uneven terrains, such as stairs, curbs, or rockbed on a trail, while avoiding obstacles and pedestrians. In our prior work, we investigated the second challenge by teaching a quadruped robot to tackle challenging uneven obstacles and various outdoor terrains. \n\n\n\nIn “IndoorSim-to-OutdoorReal: Learning to Navigate Outdoors without an…",
