          "description": "Over the past decades, the machine learning community has developed tons of data-driven techniques aimed at enhancing learning efficiency, like semi-supervised learning, meta learning, active learning, transfer learning, and more. However, none of these techniques have proven to be highly effective for real-world natural language processing tasks. This shortcoming uncovers a fundamental flaw in machine learning - the absence of reasoning. Humans often learn from just a few examples because of their capacity to reason, as opposed to relying on data statistics. In this talk, I will talk about the large language models (LLM) reasoning work that we pioneered, and show that the techniques we developed can greatly narrow the gap between human intelligence and machine learning - crushed SoTA in the literature while demanding only a few annotated examples and no training. Our work was presented by Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2022 as a showcase of Google AI.",

          "description": "Guidance is a powerful method that can be used to enhance diffusion model sampling. As I’ve discussed in an earlier blog post, it’s almost like a cheat code: it can improve sample quality so much that it’s as if the model had ten times the number of parameters – an order of magnitude improvement, basically for free! This follow-up post provides a geometric interpretation and visualisation of the diffusion sampling procedure, which I’ve found particularly useful to explain how guidance works.",

It’s being released to a limited number of Vertex AI customers using Imagen, one of our latest text-to-image models that uses input text to create photorealistic images. This technology embeds a digital watermark directly into the pixels of an image, making it imperceptible to the human eye, but detectable for identification. While generative AI can unlock huge creative potential, it also presents new risks, like creators spreading false information — both intentionally or unintentionally. Being able to identify AI-generated content is critical to empowering people with knowledge of when they’re interacting with generated media, and for helping prevent the spread of misinformation.",
