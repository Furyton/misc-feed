Achieving this goal critically depends on the precise selection and application of suitable regularisation methods. Although there have been significant advancements in understanding explicit regularisation techniques, such as Lasso and nuclear norm minimisation, which have profoundly impacted the field in recent years, the development of regularisation approaches—especially those that are implicit or algorithmic—remains a difficult task. In this talk, we will address this challenge by exploring mirror descent, a family of first-order methods that generalise gradient descent. Using tools from probability and optimisation, we will introduce a structured framework for designing mirror maps and Bregman divergences. This framework enables mirror descent to attain optimal statistical rates in some settings in linear and kernel regression. If time permits, we will also briefly showcase the application of mirror descent in reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on the use of neural networks to learn mirror maps for policy optimisation.",

It incorporates a verification mechanism to ensure the correctness of these speculated tokens, thereby guaranteeing that the overall output of speculative decoding is identical to that of vanilla decoding. Optimizing the cost of inference of large language models (LLMs) is arguably one of the most critical factors in reducing the cost of generative AI and increasing its adoption. Towards this goal, various inference optimization techniques are available, including custom kernels, dynamic batching of input requests, and quantization of large models.",

After a deployment, Netlify calls a serverless function that hits the GitHub API with a POST request to trigger a GitHub action workflow.",

          "description": "I’ve been learning recently about how to approximate functions by low-degree polynomials. This is useful in FHE in the context of “arithmetic FHE” (see my FHE overview article), where the computational model makes low-degree polynomials cheap to evaluate and non-polynomial functions expensive or impossible.\nIn browsing the state of the art I came across two interesting things. The first is the software package lolremez that implements polynomial (and rational polynomial $f(x) / g(x)$) function approximation using the so-called Remez algorithm.",

Since then I’ve got to work on a lot of interesting projects, learning along the way about post-quantum cryptography, compiler design, and the ins and outs of fully homomorphic encryption.\nIf you’ve heard about FHE and you’re a software person, you’ve probably heard two things: it lets you run programs directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it; and it’s still too slow to be useful for anything.",
