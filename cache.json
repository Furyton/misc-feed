          "description": "Transformers have become the dominant neural network architecture in deep learning. While they are state of the art in language and vision tasks, their performance is less convincing in so-called “reasoning” tasks. In this talk, we consider the “generalization on the unseen (GOTU)\" objective to test the reasoning capabilities of neural networks, primarily Transformers on Boolean/logic tasks. We first give experimental results showing that such networks have a strong “minimal degree bias\" - they tend to find specific interpolators having low degree, in agreement with the “leap complexity” picture derived for classic generalization. Using basic concepts from Boolean Fourier analysis and algebraic geometry, we then characterize such minimal degree profile interpolators and prove two theorems about the convergence of (S)GD to such interpolators on basic architectures. Since the minimal degree profile is not desirable in many reasoning tasks, we discuss various methods to correct this bias and improve consequently the reasoning capabilities. Based primarily on joint works with S. Bengio, A. Lotfi, K. Rizk and E. Adsera-Boix, T. Misiakiewicz.",

          "description": "Goal Representations for Instruction Following\n\n\n\nFigure title. Figure caption. This image is centered and set to 50%\npage width. -->\n\n\nA longstanding goal of the field of robot learning has been to create generalist agents that can perform tasks for humans. Natural language has the potential to be an easy-to-use interface for humans to specify arbitrary tasks, but it is difficult to train robots to follow language instructions. Approaches like language-conditioned behavioral cloning (LCBC) train policies to directly imitate expert actions conditioned on language, but require humans to annotate all training trajectories and generalize poorly across scenes and behaviors. Meanwhile, recent goal-conditioned approaches perform much better at general manipulation tasks, but do not enable easy t…",

By incorporating a new component - pairwise policy gradient, we can unify the reward modeling stage and RL stage, enabling direct updates based on pairwise responses.\n\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have powered increasingly capable virtual assistants, such as GPT-4, Claude-2, Bard and Bing Chat.

          "description": "Generative AI systems are already being used to write books, create graphic designs, assist medical practitioners, and are becoming increasingly capable. To ensure these systems are developed and deployed responsibly requires carefully evaluating the potential ethical and social risks they may pose.In our paper, we propose a three-layered framework for evaluating the social and ethical risks of AI systems. This framework includes evaluations of AI system capability, human interaction, and systemic impacts.We also map the current state of safety evaluations and find three main gaps: context, specific risks, and multimodality. To help close these gaps, we call for repurposing existing evaluation methods for generative AI and for implementing a comprehensive approach to evaluation, as in our case study on misinformation. This approach integrates findings like how likely the AI system is to provide factually incorrect information, with insights on how people use that system, and in what context. Multi-layered evaluations can draw conclusions beyond model capability and indicate whether harm — in this case, misinformation — actually occurs and spreads. To make any technology work as intended, both social and technical challenges must be solved. So to better assess AI system safety, these different layers of context must be taken into account. Here, we build upon earlier research identifying the potential risks of large-scale language models, such as privacy leaks, job automation, misinformation, and more — and introduce a way of comprehensively evaluating these risks going forward.",

Just this year, communities have experienced catastrophic wildfires in Greece, Maui, and Canada to name a few. While the underlying causes leading to such an increase are complex — including changing climate patterns, forest management practices, land use development policies and many more — it is clear that the advancement of technologies can help to address the new challenges.\n \nAt Google Research, we’ve been investing in a number of climate adaptation efforts, including the application of machine learning (ML) to aid in wildfire prevention and provide information to…",

While existing features, such as “Did you mean”, already handle simple typo corrections, more complex grammatical error correction (GEC) is beyond their scope. What makes the development of new Google Search features challenging is that they must have high precision and recall while outputting results quickly.\n\n\n\nThe conventional approach to GEC is to treat it as a translation problem and use autoregressive Transformer models to decode the response token-by-token, conditioning on the previously generated tokens.

But perhaps no aspect of quantum theory is as striking as the act of measurement. In classical mechanics, a measurement need not affect the system being studied.

There are a number of reasons why city officials might enact their plan, a primary one being a natural disaster, such as a tornado, flood, or wildfire. An evacuation plan can help the community more effectively respond to an emergency, and so could help save lives. However, it can be difficult for a city to evaluate such a plan because it is not practical to have an entire town or city rehearse a full blown evacuation.
