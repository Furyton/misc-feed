Numba is a compiled language that uses the same syntax as\nPython, and it compiles at runtime, so it’s very easy to write. And\nbecause it re-implements a large part of the NumPy APIs, it can also\neasily be used with existing NumPy-based code.\nHowever, Numba’s NumPy support can be a trap: it can lead you to missing\nhuge optimization opportunities by sticking to NumPy-style code. So in\nthis article we’ll show an example of:\nThe wrong way to use Numba, writing NumPy-style full array transforms.\nThe right way to use Numba, namely for loops.\nRead more...",

Now the research community has started working on a harder task—using it for video generation. The task itself is a superset of the image case, since an image is a video of 1 frame, and it is much more challenging because\nIt has extra requirements on temporal consistency across frames, which naturally demand more world knowledge to be encoded into the model.",

Bayesian approaches start with an assumption about the data's patterns (prior probability), collecting evidence (e.g., new time series data), and continuously updating that assumption to form a posterior probability distribution. Traditional Bayesian approaches like Gaussian processes (GPs) and Structural Time Series are extensively used for modeling time series data, e.g., the commonly used Mauna Loa CO2 dataset. However, they often rely on domain experts to painstakingly select appropriate model components and may be computationally expensive.
