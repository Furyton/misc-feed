          "description": "Researchers have proposed many methods to make neural networks more reliable under distribution shift, yet there is still large room for improvement. Are better training algorithms or training data the more promising way forward? In this talk, we study this question in the context of OpenAI’s CLIP model for learning from image-text data. First, we survey the current robustness landscape based on a large-scale experimental study involving more than 200 different models and test conditions. The CLIP models stand out with unprecedented robustness on multiple challenging distribution shifts. To further improve CLIP, we then introduce new methods for reliably fine-tuning models by interpolating the weights of multiple models. Next, we investigate the cause of CLIP’s robustness via controlled experiments to disentangle the influence of language supervision and training distribution. While CLIP leveraged large scale language supervision for the first time, its robustness actually comes from the pre-training dataset. We conclude with a brief overview of ongoing work to improve pre-training datasets: LAION-5B, the largest public image-text dataset, and initial experiments to increase the robustness induced by pre-training data. Bio: Ludwig Schmidt is an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Ludwig’s research interests revolve around the empirical foundations of machine learning, often with a focus on datasets, reliable generalization, and large models. Ludwig completed his PhD at MIT under the supervision of Piotr Indyk and was a postdoc at UC Berkeley hosted by Benjamin Recht and Moritz Hardt. Recently, Ludwig’s research group contributed to multimodal language & vision models by creating OpenCLIP and the LAION-5B dataset. Ludwig’s research received a new horizons award at EAAMO, best paper awards at ICML & NeurIPS, a best paper finalist at CVPR, and the Sprowls dissertation award from MIT.",

Our results show that Koala can effectively respond to a variety of user queries, generating responses that are often preferred over Alpaca, and at least tied with ChatGPT in over half of the cases.\nWe hope that these results contribute further to the discourse around the relative performance of large closed-source models to smaller public models.

The biggest dense models for image understanding, however, have reached only 4 billion parameters, despite research indicating that promising multimodal models like PaLI continue to benefit from scaling vision models alongside their language counterparts. Motivated by this, and the results from scaling LLMs, we decided to undertake the next step in the journey of scaling the Vision Transformer.\n \n\nIn “Scaling Vision Transformers to 22 Billion Parameters”, we introduce the biggest dense vision model, ViT-22B.

          "description": "Posted by Harsh Mehta, Software Engineer, and Walid Krichene, Research Scientist, Google Research  \nLarge deep learning models are becoming the workhorse of a variety of critical machine learning (ML) tasks. However, it has been shown that without any protection it is plausible for bad actors to attack a variety of models, across modalities, to reveal information from individual training examples. As such, it’s essential to protect against this sort of information leakage. \n\nDifferential privacy (DP) provides formal protection against an attacker who aims to extract information about the training data. The most popular method for DP training in deep learning is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). The core recipe implements a common theme in DP: “fuzzing” an algorit…",

As we use these assistants, we are also becoming more accustomed to using natural language to accomplish tasks that we once did by hand.  \n   \nOne of the biggest challenges in building a robust virtual assistant is identifying what a user wants and what information is needed to perform the task at hand.

It was previously unknown that external eye photos contained signals for these conditions.

Understanding the content of videos, however, is a challenging task as videos often contain multiple events occurring at different time scales. For example, a video of a musher hitching up dogs to a dog sled before they all race away involves a long event (the dogs pulling the sled) and a short event (the dogs being hitched to the sled).
