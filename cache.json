          "description": "When machine learning models are deployed into the world, they inevitably encounter scenarios that differ from their training data, either novel contexts where the appropriate answers may differ or scenarios with new out-of-distribution inputs. Unfortunately, in such situations, deep neural network models make up answers or misunderstand the context, making the models unreliable. Even if a model makes useful predictions for many examples, such unreliability poses considerable risks when these models are interacting with real people and ultimately precludes models from being useful in safety-critical applications. In this talk, I’ll discuss some ways that we might cope with and address the unreliability of neural network models. As an initial coping strategy, I will first discuss a technique for detecting whether some content was generated by a machine learning model, leveraging the probability distribution that the model assigns to different content. Next, I will describe an approach for enabling neural network models to better estimate what they don’t know, such that they can abstain from making predictions on such inputs (i.e. selective classification). I will lastly describe methods for adapting models with small amounts of data to improve their accuracy under distribution shift.",

          "description": "How can we trace surprising behaviors of machine learning models back to their training data? Influence functions aim to predict how the trained model would change if a specific training example were added to the training set. I'll address two issues that have blocked their applicability to large-scale neural nets: apparent inaccuracy of the results, and the difficulty of computing inverse-Hessian-vector products. Towards the former issue, I'll reformulate the goals of influence estimation in a way that applies to overparameterized, incompletely trained models, and argue that the apparent inaccuracy was largely illusory. I'll then discuss an approach to scaling influence estimation to large language models and show some resulting insights into their patterns of generalization.",

          "description": "Posted by Parker Riley, Software Engineer, and Jan Botha, Research Scientist, Google Research  \nMany languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…",

Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. \n\nHowever, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including \"unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation.
