          "description": "Researchers have proposed many methods to make neural networks more reliable under distribution shift, yet there is still large room for improvement. Are better training algorithms or training data the more promising way forward? In this talk, we study this question in the context of OpenAI’s CLIP model for learning from image-text data. First, we survey the current robustness landscape based on a large-scale experimental study involving more than 200 different models and test conditions. The CLIP models stand out with unprecedented robustness on multiple challenging distribution shifts. To further improve CLIP, we then introduce new methods for reliably fine-tuning models by interpolating the weights of multiple models. Next, we investigate the cause of CLIP’s robustness via controlled experiments to disentangle the influence of language supervision and training distribution. While CLIP leveraged large scale language supervision for the first time, its robustness actually comes from the pre-training dataset. We conclude with a brief overview of ongoing work to improve pre-training datasets: LAION-5B, the largest public image-text dataset, and initial experiments to increase the robustness induced by pre-training data. Bio: Ludwig Schmidt is an assistant professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Ludwig’s research interests revolve around the empirical foundations of machine learning, often with a focus on datasets, reliable generalization, and large models. Ludwig completed his PhD at MIT under the supervision of Piotr Indyk and was a postdoc at UC Berkeley hosted by Benjamin Recht and Moritz Hardt. Recently, Ludwig’s research group contributed to multimodal language & vision models by creating OpenCLIP and the LAION-5B dataset. Ludwig’s research received a new horizons award at EAAMO, best paper awards at ICML & NeurIPS, a best paper finalist at CVPR, and the Sprowls dissertation award from MIT.",

The release of PyTorch 2.0 is yet another major milestone for this storied community and we are excited to continue to be part of it. When the PyTorch/XLA project started in 2018 between Google and Meta, the focus was on bringing cutting edge Cloud TPUs to help support the PyTorch community. Along the way, others in the community such as Amazon joined the project and very quickly the community expanded. We are excited about XLA’s direction and the benefits this project continues to bring to the PyTorch community. In this blog we’d like to showcase some key features that have been in development, show code snippets, and illustrate the benefit through some benchmarks.",

          "description": "Posted by Florian Hartmann, Software Engineer, and Peter Kairouz, Research Scientist, Google Research  \nFederated learning is a distributed way of training machine learning (ML) models where data is locally processed and only focused model updates and metrics that are intended for immediate aggregation are shared with a server that orchestrates training. This allows the training of models on locally available signals without exposing raw data to servers, increasing user privacy. In 2021, we announced that we are using federated learning to train Smart Text Selection models, an Android feature that helps users select and copy text easily by predicting what text they want to select and then automatically expanding the selection for them. \n \nSince that launch, we have worked to improve the pr…",

Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector. However, in real world HGs, there is often a label imbalance issue between different node …",
